# Open FEDEM Changelog

## [fedem-8.1.0.8] (2025-09-16)

### :rocket: Added

No new features in this release, but the use of Qt layout managers of positioning
the various GUI components is now complete, also for all the property views.

### :bug: Fixed

- The `Qt6OpenGLWidgets.dll` file is missing in the Windows installation.
- The GUI freezes when the Airfoil Browser dialog is launched on Windows.
- Some GUI components appear and disappear instantly when the Dynamics Solver dialog is launched the first time.
- The "File of type:" menu in the file selection dialog contains "All files (*)" only.
- When creating a sea wave function, the default function type is wrong (should be Sine).
- Issue https://github.com/openfedem/fedem-gui/issues/83:
  Deleting and pasting does not work for Linear derivative functions.

## [fedem-8.1.0] (2025-07-10)

### :rocket: Initial release of FEDEM R8.1

The FEDEM GUI is now built with the open-source
[Qt 6.8](https://www.qt.io/product/framework) framework.
This involves a lot of code changes to port the FEDEM sources from Qt 4 to Qt 6,
while maintaining all existing functionality.
The porting effort has been performed incrementally.
That is, first the necessary changes to build with Qt 5 were added in
a separate PR (https://github.com/openfedem/fedem-gui/pull/77),
followed by another PR (https://github.com/openfedem/fedem-gui/pull/78)
with the changes required to build with Qt 6.
Finally, through https://github.com/openfedem/fedem-gui/pull/79,
further modifications where done to make the Qt-based widgets more portable
using layout managers instead of the elaborate explicit geometry calculations.

If there is a need for continuing working with either Qt 4 or Qt 5, this can be
done if you checkout branch `fedem-8.0-qt4` or `fedem-8.1-qt5`, respectively.
These branches will not receive any significant updates in the future,
except perhaps for smaller bug-fixes which are not related to Qt 6.
All new features and major changes will be added to the main branch only.

This release also contains the first installation package for Linux platform
(built with gcc 11 and Qt 6.2 on Ubuntu 22.04).
To try out this package, just unpack the file
[Fedem-R8.1.0_Ubuntu-22.04.tar.gz](https://github.com/openfedem/fedem-gui/releases/download/fedem-8.1.0/Fedem-R8.1.0_Ubuntu-22.04.tar.gz)
in some arbitrary location `<installation-folder>`,
and launch FEDEM through the command:

        $ <installation-folder>/Fedem-8.1.0/fedem [<options>]

You will need to install the Qt 6 runtime libraries through the package manager
before doing this, as they are not included in the FEDEM distribution:

        $ sudo apt install libqt6core6 libqt6gui6 libqt6widgets6 libqt6opengl6
